## Project Overview  
MoodMusic aligns with the MoodScale task by connecting user mood to music recommendations. It lets users select how they feel and instantly generates playlists that reflect their emotional state â€” showing how digital interaction can adapt content based on mood and personality.

---
## How It Works
1. You select your mood from available options.
2. The app matches your mood to a corresponding playlist.
3. The embedded player lists tracks and allows playback.
4. Enjoy music that fits your feeling!

## Core Features  
- **Mood Selector**: Choose from moods like Happy, Sad, Energetic, or Calm  
- **Instant Playback**: Embedded audio player for seamless listening  
- **Mood-Based Songs**: Predefined playlists matched to each mood  
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop and mobile  
- **Clean UI**: Simple, enjoyable, and easy to navigate  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js, functional components, React Hooks  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / plain CSS  
- **Data**: Local JSON or static data (no backend)  
- **Hosting**: Netlify

## Challenges Faced
- Mood-based playlist curation was manual due to lack of dynamic APIs.
- No backend meant all data had to be static, limiting personalization.
- UI responsiveness across devices took effort to fine-tune.
- State management in React needed careful handling to sync mood and songs smoothly.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate Spotify or YouTube API for live playlists
- Add AI mood detection (e.g., face cameras or sentiment analysis)
- Store user preferences or add playlists favorites
- Add smooth transitions, animations, and theme toggles
- Enhance search and filter options
